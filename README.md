# エロｇｏｄｉｃ

A scripting language for interactive narrative. Barely even started.

> In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no extranoematic responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.

## Example

```lua
local Erogodic = require 'erogodic'
```

## Eventual Features
* Traverse nodes with arbitrary content: text, portraits, animations, scripting, etc.
* Control flow including: branching choices, loops, breakpoints.
* Use outside variables and conditions to constrain or direct the script.
* Support for internationalization.
* Command line script validation tool.
